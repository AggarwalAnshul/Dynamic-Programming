Probability of reaching a point with 2 or 3 steps at a time
A person starts walking from position X = 0, find the probability to reach exactly on X = N if she can only take either 2 steps or 3 steps. Probability for step length 2 is given i.e. P, probability for step length 3 is 1 â€“ P.

Examples :

Input : N = 5, P = 0.20
Output : 0.32
Explanation :-
There are two ways to reach 5.
2+3 with probability = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16
3+2 with probability = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16
So, total probability = 0.32.
There is only one obstacle in the middle.
