Given a string s, partition s such that every string of the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

For example, given s = "aab",
Return

  [
    ["a","a","b"]
    ["aa","b"],
  ]
 Ordering the results in the answer : Entry i will come before Entry j if :
len(Entryi[0]) < len(Entryj[0]) OR
(len(Entryi[0]) == len(Entryj[0]) AND len(Entryi[1]) < len(Entryj[1])) OR
*
*
*
(len(Entryi[0]) == len(Entryj[0]) AND â€¦ len(Entryi[k] < len(Entryj[k]))
In the given example,
