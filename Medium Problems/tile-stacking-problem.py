Tile Stacking Problem
A stable tower of height n is a tower consisting of exactly n tiles of unit height stacked vertically in such a way, that no bigger tile is placed on a smaller tile. An example is shown below :

We have infinite number of tiles of sizes 1, 2, â€¦, m. The task is calculate the number of different stable tower of height n that can be built from these tiles, with a restriction that you can use at most k tiles of each size in the tower.

Note: Two tower of height n are different if and only if there exists a height h (1 <= h <= n), such that the towers have tiles of different sizes at height h.

Examples:

Input : n = 3, m = 3, k = 1.
Output : 1
Possible sequences: { 1, 2, 3}. 
Hence answer is 1.

Input : n = 3, m = 3, k = 2.
Output : 7
{1, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 3}, {1, 2, 2},
{1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 3}, {2, 2, 3}, 
{2, 3, 3}.

[+]Comments                   : Already had the apporach in my mind
                                Implementation took 15 mins max
                                All test cases passed
                                Don't feel a dynamic solution is requried
                                GFG Shows a DP Solution, However my solution has the same
                                complexity as theirs, so i'm not moving into unchartered territory unnecessarily
                                Consider the matter closed
                                Now realized branch solution is needed
                                DP Added now
