Minimum removals from array to make max â€“ min <= K
Given N integers and K, find the minimum number of elements that should be removed such that Amax-Amin<=K. After removal of elements, Amax and Amin is considered among the remaining elements.
Examples:

Input : a[] = {1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 20} 
          k = 4 
Output : 5 
Explanation: Remove 1, 3, 4 from beginning 
and 17, 20 from the end.

Input : a[] = {1, 5, 6, 2, 8}  K=2
Output : 3
Explanation: There are multiple ways to 
remove elements in this case.
One among them is to remove 5, 6, 8.
The other is to remove 1, 2, 5
